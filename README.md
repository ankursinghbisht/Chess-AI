## Introduction


The game features classic Chess for player-versus-player matches. 
Additionally, it offers a Single-Player mode with a skilled Chess Bot. This AI evaluates the board and utilizing multi-layer tree branches to select its best moves.
## Why I Built it?
- AI Exploration:  I've always wanted to understand how AI works beyond the theoretical aspect. Building a chess engine lets me get hands-on experience with AI algorithms and see how they make decisions in a concrete scenario.
- Challenge and Curiosity:  I've always been intrigued by the complexity of chess and the strategic depth it offers. Building a chess engine is a way for me to challenge myself and satisfy my curiosity about how computers can master such a complex game.
- Love for Chess: I'm a huge chess enthusiast and creating a chess engine allows me to dive deeper into the game. It's like taking my passion to the next level and understanding the game from a completely different perspective.
- Skill Showcase: I see this project as a way to showcase my programming skills. It's not just about making a chess engine; it's about demonstrating my ability to tackle complex challenges and create something functional and impressive.
